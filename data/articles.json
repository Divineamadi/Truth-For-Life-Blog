But life threw her into it; used mistreated, and cast aside.</p><p>She didn't just run into the desert, she ran from pain. But, right there in her wilderness, she discov... ummm...</p><p>So sorry to cut you off at this point. I know you'll have this ? in your mind right now: who is this 'she'?<br>Well, I'm talking about Hagar, the maid of Sarah, Abraham's wife. That being answered, let's get back to it.</p><p>She discovered something most people live their whole lives without knowing:<br>'There is a GOD who sees you, even when no one else does'.</p><p>Hagar was an Egyptian servant, property in the house of Abraham and Sarah. When Sarah couldn’t bear children, she gave Hagar to Abraham as a surrogate.<br>“Go sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.”<br>(Genesis 16:2)</p><p>She had no say. She was used for her body, and then despised for what her body produced.</p><p>Once she conceived, Sarah became bitter, jealous, and cruel; so much that Hagar fled into the wilderness, pregnant and broken.</p><p><strong>Does this sound familiar?</strong><br>Used, discarded, rejected by the very people who brought you close.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>How many people today are walking through life like Hagar; running from pain, carrying burdens, and feeling invisible?</p><p><strong>The Turning Point...</strong></p><p>Here’s the part that changes everything:<br>“The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert…”<br>(Genesis 16:7)</p><p>She didn’t find GOD, He found her. Not in the palace, and certainly not in the temple, but in the desert.<br>He didn’t come with condemnation, but came with a question:<br>“Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?”</p><p>GOD wasn’t asking because He didn’t know. He asked because she didn’t. Pain had disoriented her. Hurt had blurred her vision. And He was inviting her back to clarity and purpose.</p><p>She was a slave, a woman, a foreigner, a disposable figure. And yet… God called her by name. He didn’t say “woman”, He didn’t say “maid”, He said “Hagar.”<br>In a culture that didn’t recognize her value, GOD did.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>You are not a number, not a mistake. You are not a background character in someone else’s story.<br>You are seen, named, and known.</p><p>After this encounter, Hagar says something breathtaking:<br>“You are the GOD who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.” (Genesis 16:13)</p><p>This is the first and only time in the Bible where someone gives GOD a name:<br>EL ROI – The GOD Who Sees Me.</p><p>Not the God of kings, not the God of war. But the GOD of the unseen, the GOD of the rejected. The GOD of the wilderness.</p><p>GOD sends her back, not to suffer, but to fulfill a purpose. He promises that her son Ishmael will become a great nation.<br>Her pain wasn’t in vain. Her tears birthed a promise.<br>Later in Genesis 21, she ends up in the desert again. This time, with her child.<br>And just when all hope seems lost, when the water is gone, and she lays her child down to die, GOD opens her eyes to a well nearby.</p><p>Just when you think it’s over, GOD shows you what you couldn’t see before.</p><p>Maybe you're like Hagar today.<br>Used, forgotten, or even wounded. Left to wander in a dry place, wondering if anyone sees your struggle.</p><p><strong>Let this truth be your anchor:</strong><br>You are not invisible to GOD.<br>He sees your tears.<br>He hears your cry.<br>He knows your name.<br>And He will meet you… even in the wilderness.</p><p><strong>Know this;</strong><br><strong>'EL ROI'</strong> still sees.<br>And in the place where others discard you, GOD defines you.</p><p>Thank you for reading.</p>"

    "contentHTML": "<p>Unlearning the “Normal” That makes our mind, body, and soul weak and tired.</p><p>You’ve probably seen it: a brightly packaged box of cereal labeled “heart healthy,” filled with more sugar than a dessert. Or the tired mom handing a tablet to her child at dinner so she can breathe for five minutes. Or the man at the bus stop, sipping an energy drink like it’s water, eyes dull from another sleepless night.</p><p>It’s everywhere, what we’ve come to call “normal.” But what if normal is killing us?<br>Definitely not fast, not loud, just slow enough that we stop noticing until it’s too late.</p><p>Today, it’s normal to wake up exhausted, normal to feel anxious all day, distracted by screens and deadlines. Normal to eat food with no life in it, drink caffeine to stay conscious, and scroll ourselves to sleep.</p><p><b>But here’s the problem:</b> <br>What is common has become confused with what’s acceptable.<br>We’ve accepted constant fatigue as adulthood, digestive issues as stress, headaches as part of the job, dopamine overload as entertainment, shallow relationships as connection, poor food as survival, overworking as purpose.<br>We normalize the things that are slowly draining the life out of us mentally, physically, spiritually.</p><p><b>The big question to ask here is why don’t we see it, or rather why do we overlook it even when we observe it?</b> <br>It’s because everyone else is doing it, because convenience makes dysfunction look reasonable, because we’ve stopped questioning things that come wrapped in comfort.</p><p>But when dysfunction becomes culture, truth becomes rebellion. Remember what the Bible says;<br><i>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge…” – Hosea 4:6</i> </p><p>People are tired, bloated, anxious, inflamed, addicted to sugar and screens, emotionally numb, relationally disconnected and they think it’s just life. No it’s not life, it’s life being hijacked.</p><p>You know God didn’t design our bodies for chronic stress. He didn’t create our minds for nonstop noise, neither did he wire our children for processed food, artificial light, and emotional isolation.</p><p>The truth is that our body is speaking but are we listening? <br>The pain is a message, the burnout is a warning, the numbness is not peace, it’s disconnection; and healing doesn’t begin with a pill, it begins with awareness of the truth and then application of the truth you have been exposed to.</p><p>Now some “normal” things we’ve accepted that don’t belong in a healthy, human life includes: <br><ol><li>Ultra-processed food with no nutritional value.</li><li>Caffeine dependence to fake energy.</li><li>Dopamine addiction through endless scrolling.</li><li>Poor sleep cycles masked with supplements.</li><li>Multitasking instead of mindfulness.</li><li>Emptiness masked as busyness.</li><li>Shallow connections instead of real relationships.</li><li>Anxiety passed off as ambition.</li></ol></p><p>We’ve accepted a lifestyle that fights the way we were made to live. We are not powerless, and we don’t have to obey the chaos of culture. The scripture rightly stated;<br><i>“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” – Romans 12:2</i></p><p>We were made to live not survive, to breathe deeply, to move freely, to think clearly, and to live with purpose, not panic.</p><p>We are created with a purpose to fulfill, which cannot happen in ignorance. That’s why we have to become aware of what to do or steps to take in order to attain a healthy and fulfilled life.</p><p>First, you start off by noticing what you’ve accepted without question, then you challenge every “normal” that doesn’t align with peace, health, and wholeness. After which, begin with making small changes, return to simplicity, rest, eat real food and reconnect with GOD.</p><p>Your body isn’t disposable, it’s sacred and carries purpose.</p><p>You weren’t created to be chronically tired, overstimulated, and spiritually dry. And you don’t need a miracle to begin healing.<br>You just need the courage to say:</p><p>“I refuse to accept what’s killing me.” That’s how truth begins to heal a generation which you’re also part of.</p>",

    "contentHTML": "<p><b>Introduction:</b> Are We Really Living, or Just Surviving?</p><p>Look around: energy drinks for breakfast, meds for lunch, and scrolling until sleep. More people are feeling tired, anxious, bloated, overweight, and dependent on pills, yet this has quietly become the norm.</p><p>But here’s the real crisis: most don’t even realize how far from 'well' they’ve drifted. The world is fighting silent battles with health, fitness, and food, but the funny thing is, just a few out of the entire world population is actually winning.</p><p>This article reveals why we’re stuck in this cycle, how it got this bad, and what we must do to reclaim our energy, health, and full life back.</p><img src='images/health.jpg'><p><b>1. Health: Chronic Illness Is the New Normal.</b><br>We live in an age of medical miracles and yet, we’re sicker than ever. Chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and mental health issues are rising in every corner of the globe.</p><p><b>What changed?</b><br>We’ve swapped prevention for prescription. Instead of tackling root causes, we treat symptoms. What's worse is that, daily stress, poor sleep, and emotional burnout have become background noise.</p><p>This isn’t just about aging. Teenagers are developing adult diseases. Young people now experience burn out in their twenties, an indication that 'health' isn’t just failing, it’s disappearing.</p><img src='images/fitness.jpg'><p><b>2. Fitness: Weak Bodies in a Modern World.</b><br>The average human is moving less than ever in history. Before the advent of technology, historic record has shown that Man has accomplished great things (by hand) without the effort of machines. A few examples would include;<br>The building of the Tower of Babel, the building of Noah’s Ark, the construction of the Pyramid of Egypt etc.<br>These records show that Man’s strength was exceptionally great then, than compared to now. Most of us sit for hours daily at desks, in cars, on couches, barely engaging our bodies.</p><p>This isn’t just about getting “fit” or losing weight. It’s about losing our strength, stamina, and vitality. Even walking is a challenge for some. Muscles waste, posture collapses, and injury risk rises.</p><p><b>Why, You May Ask?</b><br>Because modern life is designed for comfort, not capability. Elevators, cars, delivery apps, and screens make physical effort optional. But what’s optional becomes avoidable and then, forgotten.</p><img src='images/nutrition.jpg'><p><b>3. Food: Fed but Malnourished</b> <br>There’s more food than ever, but less nutrition. Heavily processed meals, refined sugars, artificial ingredients, and empty calories dominate diets across the world.</p><p>Even those who think they eat “healthy” are often misled by marketing labels and poor education. Real food such as vegetables, fruits, quality proteins, healthy fats is being replaced by fast food, packaged snacks, and sugary drinks.</p><p><b>The result?</b><br>Inflammation, gut damage, hormonal chaos, and constant cravings. We’re full but starved. And the scariest part: our taste buds are addicted, and our bodies are confused.</p><img src='images/why.jpg'><p><b>4. Why Is This Happening?</b> <br>Several forces keep us in this unhealthy loop:<br>Culture: We glorify hustle over rest, junk over nourishment, and screens over sunlight.<br><ul><li>Education: Schools barely teach real health, cooking, or movement.</li><li>Industry: The health, pharmaceutical, and food industries profit more when you're sick, tired, and addicted.</li></ul></p><img src='images/realcost.png'><p><b>5. The Real Cost of Staying Unwell</b><br>This is deeper than just health. It’s about quality of life. We’re losing:<ul><li>Energy: Constant fatigue becomes the baseline.</li><li>Focus: Brain fog and distraction rule.</li><li>Joy: Anxiety, depression, and emotional numbness rise. That’s why the Bible encourages us to be joyful. John 15:11, Philippians 4:4, Proverbs 17:22.</li><li>Productivity: A sick body can’t power a sharp mind.</li><li>Generational Health: Kids inherit habits, not just genes.</li></ul><br>We aren’t just tired, we’re disconnected from our potential.</p><img src='images/solution.jpg'><p><b>6. How to Reclaim Health and Power</b><br>You don’t need perfection. You need awareness and small, consistent change. Here’s where to begin:<br><ul><li>Eat real food: Whole, seasonal, unprocessed meals. Think “single ingredient” foods.</li><li>Move daily: Walk, lift, stretch. Take it a step at a time, you can start off with 10 minutes. Let momentum build, and maintain consistency.</li><li>Sleep deeply: Aim for 7–8 hours. Guard your rest like gold.</li><li>Unplug regularly: Cut screen time. Reclaim silence and stillness.</li><li>Hydrate often: Water over soda or energy drinks.</li></ul></p><p>Experts recommend that males consume 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water daily and females 11.5 cups (2.7 liters). But environmental factors such as temperature and other health conditions may affect your water needs.<br><ul><li>Get sunlight: Vitamin D, fresh air, and natural rhythms reset your body.</li><li>Breathe and manage stress: Deep breaths, nature, journaling, prayer, regulate your nervous system.</li><li>Build community: Loneliness is deadly. Connection heals.</li><li>Learn to listen to your body: Hunger, fatigue, cravings, they’re signals, not annoyances.</li></ul></p><img src='images/conclusion.jpg'><p><b>Reclaim Your Health, Reclaim Your Life.</b><br>You were not made to be sick, tired, and overwhelmed. You were made to thrive.</p><p>It’s time to take your health personally, not because it’s trendy, but because it’s transformational. Start small. Be patient. And remember: the most powerful change doesn’t come from a new product, it comes from a new mindset.</p><p>Choose health, not because you have to, but because you finally realize that you deserve it.</p>",

What happens inside your body when you keep feeding it sugar?</p><img src='images/sugardanger.jpg'><p>Every time you eat sugar, your <b>blood glucose spikes.</b> Your body creates a system which tries to fix this by releasing insulin, the hormone that pulls sugar out of the blood.<br>But when we do it too often, the system starts to break and results in a process called insulin resistance—the road to type 2 diabetes.</p><p><b>Sugar triggers chronic inflammation.</b> <br>This silent fire spreads through the body, causing heart disease, cancer growth, arthritis, brain fog and memory loss.</p><p>Sugar activates the same parts of the brain as cocaine and heroin. It hijacks your reward system, making you crave more and more. That’s why it’s so hard to stop.<br>Even a small dose of sugar can reduce your immune strength for hours. Imagine living that way every day, no wonder people are sick so often.</p><p><b>It also results in Liver damage.</b> Your body turns excess sugar into fat in the liver, leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition once rare but now common, even in children.</p><p>Now, having this understanding, what can you do for a change?<br>Here’s the good news:<br><b>You can break free.</b> <br>It won’t happen overnight, but it’s possible, and necessary if you want to live the life God designed for you.</p><p><b>Step 1: Detox Your Life</b> <br>Remove added sugars from your diet for 21 days. Let your taste buds heal, and watch your cravings gradually fade.</p><p><b>Step 2: Eat Real Food</b> <br>Choose foods that’s close to the way God made it. A few examples would be fruits (in moderation), vegetables, grains, clean proteins, water.</p><p><b>Step 3: Pray for Strength</b> <br>This is not just about willpower, it’s a spiritual battle. Pray for discipline over your appetite. Ask God to break the stronghold of sugar in your life.</p><p><b>Step 4: Remember Why You’re Here</b> <br>You weren’t made just to survive.<br>You were created to live strong, serve others, and glorify God. And achieving this requires energy, clarity, and health; these are the things sugar steals from you.</p><p><b>It is important to remember and understand that:</b> <br>The enemy doesn’t always come with a sword. Sometimes he comes with a cookie or even a candy, so be on guard.</p><p>Thank you for reading, please don’t forget to share with someone who might really need this enlightenment.</p>",

Remember; 'evil or unhealthy communication will definitely corrupt good manners'.</li><li>Overworking without rest which burns out your spirit.</li><li>Ignoring nature: It disconnects you from reality. So, simplify your life. Go back to real food, real movement, real conversations, and real rest.</li></ol></p><p><b>Strengthen Your Body, Because It’s Your Earthly Vehicle.</b> <br>You cannot live purposefully if you’re always tired, weak, or sick. Ensure to move daily (walk, stretch, lift, dance, just move).</p><p>Prioritize sleep (no screen scrolling into the night).

Focus deeply on one thing at a time. Multitasking is a lie.</p><p>Guard your inputs, because your life is shaped by what you watch, read, and listen to.</p><p><b>Serve Others, Not Just Yourself</b> <br>Purpose isn’t found in self-centered success, it’s found in service.<br>Like the scripture says;<br><i>'For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters.

One day, every person will stand before God, so live your life with that day in mind. Don’t just chase comfort here and forget about eternity.</p><p><i>That’s the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty.<br>GOD will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.

You may be underslept, and it’s important to know that poor sleep wrecks recovery, hormones, and muscle repair which is needed for effective build-up. No sleep = no progress.</p><p>It could also be that your nutrition is not right. You might be under-eating, especially protein, or eating too much ultra-processed “healthy” food that spikes insulin and crashes energy.</p><p>Another reason would be that you’re stressed all the time. Chronic stress floods your system with cortisol which may block fat loss, ruin sleep, and keep your body in <b>survival mode.</b></p><p>Could it be that you are overtraining, instead of training smart. Note, more is not always better. Without rest, your body can’t rebuild. You’re just breaking it down.</p><p>Or you’re Lacking Structure. You know sometimes we may feel that random workouts equals random results, but that is not always the case. Having a well planned structure you follow consistently fixes it all.</p><p>Your body needs progression and purpose not chaos.</p><p><b>Now, What Needs to Change?</b></p><p>If you really want change, it’s time to shift from “just working out” to “training and living intelligently.”</p><p>First of all, you need to start prioritizing sleep. At best 7–9 hours no excuses.</p><p>Next, start eating real foods and ditch the sugar traps. Eating balanced meals and enough protein is a great way to begin.</p><p>Follow up by managing stress. Ensure to walk few steps daily, breathe, journal, and get enough sunlight.</p><p>Train Smart, focus on strength, mobility, and consistency. Ensure to recover well because rest days are where growth happens.</p><p>Track less emotionally, more intentionally because progress is data, not drama.</p><p>💬 Finally, If you’ve been grinding with nothing to show for it, know this: <br>You don’t need more willpower, you need better alignment. Fitness isn’t punishment, it’s not hustle for hustle’s sake. It’s a conversation with your body, and your body has been trying to tell you:<br>“I need more than just movement. I need you to listen.”</p>",
